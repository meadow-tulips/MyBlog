<p style="color:violet"> Manutd looks in disarray after their recent debacle against Sevilla. But did not you see this coming? </p>

<p>After all, We have a team with an Attacking Midfielders (<b>Antonio Valencia</b> & <b>Ashley Young</b>) converted into full-backs. We got a midfield consisting on <b>Marouane Fellaini</b> with absolu<u>te no acce</u>rleration and no off the ball movement. Our Winger <b>Juan Mata</b> does not want to run down the flanks. Our <b>Anthony martial</b> is too predictable, the fact he choose the selfish option of cutting inside and taking the shot on. He may have scored some good goals from outside the box but only against weaker oppositions and average defenders. World Class defender would not let him do that.
</p>

<p>Then we arrive at our Strikers . **Lukaku** does score goals, but misses a lot too and so does rashford. Also, lukaku do have a poor record against big teams. 
</p>  

<p> **Luke Shaw ? Matteo Damian ?** are nowhere near Manutd quality. They barely make overlapping runs. 
We need our Jordi Alba, our David Alba 
Our full-backs will never be able to fill the voids of Patrice Evra or Heinze or Neville . 
</p>
<p>
And Our Cute defenders just don't know how to pass the ball from the back. All Manutd do nowdays, is to kick the ball upto Lukaku, Pogba, Zlatan or Fellaini. ? 
This is how Mourinho lines up his squad. Is this the *football Heritable* this guy was talking about. And he is questioning the old trafford atmosphere. 
</p>
**Well to be honest, it's filthy to watch Manutd Play now days. Barely a shadow of what they used to be**.

The Conclusion: 

Midfielders are too slow . 
Attackers are too arrogant and too slow to make runs & off the ball movements.
Defenders cannot pass the ball from the back. 

There is no sheilding defensive midfielder, no impetus like YAYA TOURE in his prime, like Casemiro right now in Real Madrid.
Matic only plays with his left foot. Isn't naturally quick. But has settled fine. 

We do need a huge squad overhaul.
The only players good enough for this squad are :
*Degea 
*Lingard(the fact that he scores important goals)
*Bailey,
*Pogba(he needs to play maturely) 
*Perhaps Martial.

Rest squad is just not good enough.

Honestly it was tough watching Manutd play. Mourinho has a reputation of throwing lot of cash. He is not known to create attacking minded team. His play does not involve one touch.
More like park the bus and attack on counters. 

Manutd supporters needs entertainment. One touch football, Off the ball movement, overlapping runs.
Not some park the bus stuff. 

Mourinho is just lucky to have won two champions league crown. No disrespect to him. He was quintessential in Chelsea's 86 unbeaten run at stamford bridge . But he is never known to play stylish one touch brand of football. 

And it certainly looks very unlikely to change. 

**P.S: I love Manutd**.
