## Debacle against Sevilla. But tell me, didn't you see that coming? 

<p>After all, We have a team with Attacking Midfielders (<b>Antonio Valencia</b> & <b>Ashley Young</b>) converted into full-backs. We got a midfield consisting on <b>Marouane Fellaini</b> with absolu<u>te no acce</u>rleration and no of<u>f the ba</u>ll movement. Our Winger <b>Juan Mata</b> just does not have the pace to run down the flanks. Our <b>Anthony martial</b> is too predictable, the fact that he choose the selfish option of cutting inside and taking the shot on. 
</p>    
> He may have curled some beautiful goals from outside the box but only against weaker oppositions and average defenders. World Class defenders would never let him get a sniff of goal the moment he comes inside.


<p>Then we arrive at our Strikers . <b>Lukaku</b> does score goals, but misses a lot too and so does <b>rashford</b>. Also, <b>lukaku</b> does have a poor record against big teams. 
</p>  

<p> <b>Luke Shaw</b> ? <b>Matteo Damian</b> ? are nowhere near Manutd quality. They barely make overlapping runs. We need our Jordi Alba, our David Alba. Our full-backs today look very unlikely to fill the voids of Patrice Evra or Heinze or Neville. Although I do admit that valencia is doing a great job.
</p>

<p>And by the way, our <i>cute</i> defenders just don't know how to play the ball from the back. All Manutd do nowadays, is to kick the ball as far as they can to either Lukaku, Pogba or Fellaini. ? This is how Mourinho lines up his squad. Is this the *football Heritable* this guy was talking about. And he is questioning the old trafford atmosphere. 
</p>

> Well, to be honest it's filthy to watch Manutd Play now days. Barely a shadow of what they used to be.


### The Conclusion: 

> Midfielders are too slow . 
> Attackers are too arrogant and too slow to make runs & off the ball movements.
> Defenders cannot pass the ball from the back. 

There is no sheilding defensive midfielder, no impetus like YAYA TOURE in his prime, like Casemiro right now in Real Madrid.
Matic only plays with his left foot. And Isn't naturally quick. But has settled fine. 
<p>
We do need a huge squad overhaul. The only players good enough for me are:
<ul>
    <li>Degea</li> 
    <li>Lingard(the fact that he scores important goals)</li>
    <li>Bailey</li>
    <li>Pogba(he needs to play maturely)</li>
    <li>And Perhaps Martial</li>
 </ul>

Rest of the squad is simply there for the money and they are happy with it. Some of them do work hard but they would never going to be world class. And We need world Class players to play attractive football.

Honestly it was tough watching Manutd play. Mourinho has a reputation of throwing lot of cash (Shevchenko, Ballack). He is not known for playing one touch, keep the ball kind of play. His team's play does not involve keeping possession. He believes in counter attacking. 

**More like park the bus and attack on counters**. 

Manutd supporters needs entertainment. One touch football, Off the ball movement, overlapping runs.
Not some park the bus stuff.

Mourinho is just lucky to have won two champions league crown. No disrespect to him. He was quintessential in Chelsea's 86 unbeaten run at stamford bridge . But he is never known to play stylish one touch brand of football. 

And it certainly looks very unlikely to change. 

**P.S: I am a big Manutd fan**.
