## Debacle against Sevilla. But tell me, did not you see this coming? 

<p>After all, We have a team with Attacking Midfielders (<b>Antonio Valencia</b> & <b>Ashley Young</b>) converted into full-backs. We got a midfield consisting on <b>Marouane Fellaini</b> with absolu<u>te no acce</u>rleration and no of<u>f the ba</u>ll movement. Our Winger <b>Juan Mata</b> just does not have the pace to run down the flanks. Our <b>Anthony martial</b> is too predictable, the fact he choose the selfish option of cutting inside and taking the shot on. He may have scored some good goals from outside the box but only against weaker oppositions and average defenders. World Class defender would not let him do that.
</p>

<p>Then we arrive at our Strikers . <b>Lukaku</b> does score goals, but misses a lot too and so does <b>rashford</b>. Also, <b>lukaku</b> do have a poor record against big teams. 
</p>  

<p> <b>Luke Shaw</b> ? <b>Matteo Damian</b> ? are nowhere near Manutd quality. They barely make overlapping runs. We need our <i>Jordi Alba</i>, our <i>David Alba</i> .Our full-backs today will never be able to fill the voids of <i>Patrice Evra or Heinze or Neville</i> . 
</p>
<p>
And Our Cute defenders just don't know how to pass the ball from the back. All Manutd do nowdays, is to kick a long ball to Lukaku, Pogba or Fellaini. ? This is how Mourinho lines up his squad. Is this the *football Heritable* this guy was talking about. And he is questioning the old trafford atmosphere. 
</p>
>> Well, to be honest it's filthy to watch Manutd Play now days. Barely a shadow of what they used to be.


### The Conclusion: 

> Midfielders are too slow . 
> Attackers are too arrogant and too slow to make runs & off the ball movements.
> Defenders cannot pass the ball from the back. 

There is no sheilding defensive midfielder, no impetus like YAYA TOURE in his prime, like Casemiro right now in Real Madrid.
Matic only plays with his left foot. Isn't naturally quick. But has settled fine. 
<p>
We do need a huge squad overhaul. The only players good enough for me are:
<ul>
    <li>Degea</li> 
    <li>Lingard(the fact that he scores important goals)</li>
    <li>Bailey</li>
    <li>Pogba(he needs to play maturely)</li>
    <li>And Perhaps Martial</li>
 </ul>

Rest of the squad is simply receving money and they are happy with it. Some of them do work hard but they would never going to be world class. And We need world Class players to play attractive football.
</p>

Honestly it was tough watching Manutd play. Mourinho has a reputation of throwing lot of cash. He is not known for creating one touch, keep the ball kind of play. His team's play does not involve keeping possession. He believes in counter attacking. 
More like park the bus and attack on counters. 

Manutd supporters needs entertainment. One touch football, Off the ball movement, overlapping runs.
Not some park the bus stuff.

Mourinho is just lucky to have won two champions league crown. No disrespect to him. He was quintessential in Chelsea's 86 unbeaten run at stamford bridge . But he is never known to play stylish one touch brand of football. 

And it certainly looks very unlikely to change. 

**P.S: I am a big Manutd fan**.
