Manutd are in disarray after their recent debacle against Sevilla. But who did not see this coming. 

After all, We have a team with an Attacking Midfielder (**Antonio Valencia**) converted into full back. 
We got a midfield consisting on **Marouane Fellaini** with absolute no accerleration and no off the ball movement.
Our Winger **Juan Mata** does not provide accerleration down the flanks. 

We got **Anthony martial** who is too predictable in the fact that most of the time he wants to cut inside and take the shot on or fails to deliver the final ball.

**Lukaku** does score goals but misses a lot too so does rashford. And  lukaku also have a poor record against big teams. 

**Luke Shaw ? Matteo Damian ?** are just not the quality of Manutd . They barely makes an overlapping runs. 
Look at Barcelona's full-back Jordi Alba, Bayern's full-back David Alba . Remember how Zabaleta made runs down the flanks to provide width back in 2009-12.
Our full-backs are nowhere near the quality of Manutd. They will never be able to replace Patrice Evra or Heinze or Neville . 

Our Defenders also cannot pass the ball from the back. All Manutd do is to kick the ball upto Lukaku and Fellaini. ? 
This is how Mourinho lines up his squad. Is this the *football Heritable* this guy is talking about. And he is questioning the old trafford atmosphere. 

**Well it's filthy to watch Manutd Play now days. They are barely a shadow of what Manutd were used to be in 2007**.

Midfielders are too slow . 
Attackers are too arrogant and too slow to make runs & off the ball movements.
Defenders cannot pass the ball from the back. 

There is no sheilding defensive midfielder, no impetus like YAYA TOURE in his prime, like Casemiro right now in Real Madrid.
Matic can only play with his left foot. He is not that quick either. Although he has performed fine. 

We need a huge squad overhaul . 
The only players good enough for this squad are : Degea, Lingard(the fact that he scores important goals), Bailey, Pogba(he needs to drop his arrogance), perhaps Martial.
Rest squad is just not good enough.

Honestly it was tough watching Manutd play. Mourinho has a reputation of throwing lot of cash. He is not known to create attacking minded team. His play does not involve one touch.
More like park the bus and attack on counters. 

Manutd supporters needs entertainment. One touch football, Off the ball movement, overlapping runs.
Not some park the bus stuff. 

Mourinho is just lucky to have won two champions league. No disrespect to him. He was quintessential in Chelsea's 86 unbeaten run at stamford bridge . But he is never known to play one touch Style football. 

And that looks very unlikely to change.
